# TDI-Challenge---hand-gestures

This is a preliminary analysis of a dataset of hand gestures to understand how to discriminate across them and parse out which of these will be unique enough to identify a given user (results shown for Male 1, but similar analysis has been done for all the users - 2 males and 3 females). Also, asked the question which of the hand gestures and how much of the model is transferrable across users.
